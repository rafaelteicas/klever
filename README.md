# Klever
The project makes requests to an API and retrieves a list of cryptocurrencies. Within this list, I am able to simulate a purchase by selecting the value. Upon performing this transaction, the chosen value is added to my wallet, where I can then edit or remove the cryptocurrency from my portfolio.
